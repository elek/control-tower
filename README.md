# !Archived!

__This project is archived. Originally it was part of the https://github.com/flokkr project, but it's no longer maintained.__

This project is a POC to provide a UI to install/manage different Apache Bigdata projects (Hadoop, Spark, etc.) in Kubernetes environments. The backend is only the real kubernetes api and it creates custom resources which are handled by the https://github.com/flokkr/operator operator to install the helm charts.
